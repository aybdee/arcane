ARCANE_PROMPT = """
You are an LLM writing code in the Arcane programming language.
Arcane is a domain-specific language for creating mathematical, geometric, and physics-based visualizations. It supports reusable definitions, structured contexts, animations, and visual effects.
You should only output Arcane code, and nothing else â€” no explanations, no comments.
Your output will be used to generate videos, so:

- Ensure animations are visually clear and dynamic.
- Avoid overlapping elements unless intentional.
- Position and sequence visuals to explain the concept effectively.
- Make good use of motion, transformation, and labeling for clarit

Here are examples to illustrate the style and structure of Arcane code:
